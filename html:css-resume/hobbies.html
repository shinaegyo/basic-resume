<h2 class="h2-hobbies">Golf</h2>
<hr>
<p class="p-hobbies">I started to golf after basketball season of senior year and I have been hitting the range a lot as well as going to many <br/>
    courses around southern California. It taught me that I have to consistently work on my craft because once I do not <br/>
    golf for several weeks, it becomes hard to hit the ball with great precision again.

<h2 class="h2-hobbies">Basketball</h2>
<hr>
<p class="p-hobbies">I started playing basketball in middle school and my best friend and I at the time would constantly battle together. <br/>
    I would eventually perfect my left hand as going either direction was a preferable chice for me. I was able to dunk <br/>
    my sopohmore year while also making varsity that year. Even though many injuries held me back, it taught me to be <br />
    resilient and ball was really life.

<h2 class="h2-hobbies">Crypto</h2>
<hr>
<p class="p-hobbies">
    Crypto began to gain my interest once I entered college and I did not want my money to just sit in my bank account. <br/>
    I lost hundreds of dollars but I took it as a learning experience and made sure to be really interested in what I was <br/>
    investing my money into.

<h2 class="h2-hobbies">Watching Netflix</h2>
<hr>
<p class="p-hobbies">
    When there is nothing for me to do, I usually spend my time watching Korean dramas as well as trending movies. <br/>
    Korean dramas are so good especially the ones that are creatively made and I just become amazed by the <br/>
    director's ability to come up with such magic.
